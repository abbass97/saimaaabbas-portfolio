      <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website!</p>

      <p>
        I am Saima, a data analyst with a passion for uncovering hidden insights
        and transforming them into actionable strategies. My unique blend of
        skills, honed through a diverse academic background spanning Biological
        Sciences, English Literature, and Multimedia Computing, allows me to
        approach data with a fresh perspective. I'm proficient in a variety of
        programming languages and data analysis tools, including Python, SQL, R,
        and Tableau. I'm also experienced in machine learning techniques, such
        as Sci-kit Learn, predictive analytics, sentiment analysis, regression
        models, clustering, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and NLP. I am a
        highly analytical and detail-oriented problem-solver with a proven
        ability to communicate complex data insights to both technical and
        non-technical audiences. I am also a strong collaborator and team
        player, with a passion for using data to drive positive change.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy reading fiction and tech blogs, experiment with
        new recipes and play badminton. I am a strong advocate for data literacy
        and believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn how to
        use data to make informed decisions.
      </p>

      <h1 class="main_heading">My Story</h1>

      <p>
        My journey into data analysis began with a fascination for the power of
        data to tell stories and solve problems. I was particularly drawn to the
        ability of data to reveal hidden patterns and trends, and to provide
        insights that could be used to make better decisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, this journey was anything but traditional! It started with a
        fascination for sciences, an appreciation for storytelling in
        literature, and a passion for problem-solving in computing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early on, I thrived in academia, earning degrees in Biological Sciences
        and English Literature, which sharpened my research and analytical
        skills. Later, intrigued by the ubiquitous nature of technology, I
        explored Multimedia Computing which provided me with a strong foundation
        in programming (Java, PHP, SQL), data mining, and software design,
        complemented by creative projects in web development and multimedia
        systems. Before acquiring my degree in Multimedia Computing, I worked as
        primary class teacher and teaching assistant in different schools across
        different countries. This experience not only enhanced my communication
        and collaboration skills, which allow me to engage effectively with
        diverse teams and stakeholders, but it also gave me an opportunity to
        analyse students’ progress and make data-driven decisions without
        realising!
      </p>

      <p>
        This rich experience, combined with the specialised training in Data
        Analytics at LSE which I completed with distinction in November 2024
        solidified my path. At LSE, I completed hands-on projects across
        finance, healthcare, and retail, applying exploratory data analysis,
        sentiment analysis, predictive analytics, machine learning frameworks
        (Scikit-learn), and data visualisation tools to real-world datasets.
      </p>

      <p>
        I blend my technical skills with a creative, storytelling approach to
        turn raw data into meaningful insights. I’m passionate about working
        with organisations that value data-driven decision-making and innovative
        solutions.
