      <h3>Overview:</h3>
      <p>
        As part of the
        <strong>LSE Data Analytics Online Career Accelerator</strong> (Course 3:
        Advanced Analytics for Organisational Impact), this project explored how
        Turtle Games can use data to improve marketing, customer retention, and
        decision-making. The goal was to understand loyalty patterns, segment
        customer groups, and analyse sentiment from customer reviews.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used <strong>Python and R</strong> to perform predictive modelling,
        clustering, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Datasets were drawn
        from customer demographics, loyalty behaviour, and customers' reviews
        data.
      </p>

      <h3>For the analysis, I focused on:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Predicting loyalty using salary, spending, age, and product
          interactions
        </li>
        <li>
          Building decision tree models to identify high-impact loyalty drivers
        </li>
        <li>
          Clustering customers into actionable market segments using K-Means
        </li>
        <li>
          Performing sentiment analysis on customers' review data using NLP
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        Based on the observations and insights, I was able to make the following
        recommendations:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Target high-income, high-spending customers for premium loyalty
          programs
        </li>
        <li>Focus marketing on ages 32–34, the most loyal age group</li>
        <li>
          Engage low-spending, high-income customers with discounts or
          incentives
        </li>
        <li>
          Track product purchase frequency in future datasets for deeper
          insights
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage detailed reviews to supplement positive but neutral review
          trends
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Approach:</h3>
      <p>
        To answer Turtle Games’ key business questions, I applied a multi-method
        data analysis strategy combining both Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn,
        Matplotlib, Seaborn, TextBlob) and R. Key steps included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Cleaning & Preparation:</strong> Removed irrelevant
          variables, handled missing values, encoded categorical fields (like
          gender and education), and transformed skewed variables such as
          loyalty scores.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regression Modelling (R):</strong> Tested multiple linear
          models to predict loyalty points. The most accurate and interpretable
          model was the one with <strong> Salary + Age + Spending</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Decision Tree Regression (Python):</strong> Built and pruned
          Decision Trees mRegressor models to visualise loyalty drivers.
          Spending and Salary emerged as the most influential predictors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> Segmented customers into 5
          distinct groups based on income and spending behaviour to support
          targeted marketing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Used TextBlob to analyse the
          review text. Most reviews were neutral to positive, highlighting
          general satisfaction and areas to improve user experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Insights Summary:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Loyalty peaks among customers aged 32–34, and those with high salary
          and spending.
        </li>

        <br />

        <li>
          Female and Basic-Education customers show slightly higher loyalty.

        <br />
        <li>
          Spending and Salary are the strongest loyalty predictors; Product
          offers limited insight.

          Five customer clusters are identified via K-Means segmentation, each
          with unique income–spending traits.

      </ul>

      <h4>Sentiment Insights</h4>
      <ul>
