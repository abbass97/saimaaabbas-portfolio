      <h3>Overview:</h3>
      <p>
        2Market, a global supermarket, conducted a customer sales and marketing
        review which revealed a significantly lower online purchases via
        different social media platforms compared to their in-store sales. With
        the goal of increasing online revenue and improving lead conversion
        rates, I was tasked with analysing customers’ purchasing behaviour,
        demographics, and effectiveness of various advertising channels. I
        conducted a descriptive and diagnostic analysis of the supermarket’s
        marketing and social media advertising data. The analysis focused on
        identifying high-performing product categories, preferred platforms
        across demographics, and regional purchasing trends.
        <br />
        <br />Based on the gathered insights, I was able to make the following
        recommendations: 
        <ul>
        <li>To boost online sales and lead conversions, supermarket
        sales department should target customers aged 50–65 in Spain, Saudi
        Arabia, and Canada via Twitter, Instagram, and Bulk Mail. 
        </li>
        <li>The campaigns
        should focus on promoting liquor and non-vegetable products—categories
        most aligned with the purchasing patterns of this segment.
        </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Approach:</h3>
      <p>For this project Excel, SQL, PgAdmin and Tableau were used.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Cleaning & Processing:</strong> Prior to conducting
          Exploratory Data Analysis, the data was cleaned and pre-processed
          using Excel functions and filters to remove any outliers and blank
          spaces. For data integrity, the data was checked for duplicates,
          spelling errors and name inconsistencies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exploratory Analysis:</strong> Descriptive statistical
          analysis and Pivot Table in Microsoft Excel and advanced SQL queries
          in PgAdmin were run to explore customer demographics, their purchase
          behaviour and ad platform effectiveness. Here is an example of a SQL
          code I used:
        </li>

        <pre>
          <code>
            The total spend per product per country

SELECT "country", 
SUM(m."liquor_sale") AS total_liqour_sales, 
SUM(m."fish_sale") AS total_fish_sales, 
SUM(m."veg_sale") AS total_veg_sales, 
SUM(m."nonveg_sale") AS total_non_veg_sales,
SUM(m."choc_sale") AS total_chocolate_sales, 
SUM(m."comm_sale") AS total_commodities_sales
FROM public.marketing_data m
GROUP BY "country"
ORDER BY "country" DESC;


          </code>
        </pre>

        <li>
          <strong>Data Visualisation: </strong>Tableau was used to create
          interactive and engaging visualisations to showcase key findings.
          Excel charts and graphs were also used to display the insights.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Insights:</h3>

          54, with spending patterns varying by age and income as seen in the

          <strong>Advertising Effectiveness:</strong> Twitter, Instagram, and
          Bulk Mail are the most successful ad platforms.
        </li>

        <img
          id="popular_platform"
          src="Images/popular_platform.jpg"
          alt="Most popular social media platform"
          width="1000"

        />

        <li>
          <strong>Regional Insights:</strong> Spain recorded the highest total
          sales, while households with fewer children spent more on groceries.
