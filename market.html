      <h3>Overview:</h3>
      <p>
        2Market, a global supermarket, noticed that their online purchases via
        social media were significantly lower than in-store sales. The company
        sought insights into customer behaviour and demographics. They also
        wanted to explore advertising effectiveness and best-selling products to
        improve sales revenue and lead conversion.
      </p>
      <h3>Approach:</h3>
      <p>For this project Excel, SQL and Tableau were used.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Cleaning & Processing:</strong> Prior to conducting
          Exploratory Data Analysis, the data was cleaned and pre-processed
          using Excel functions and filters to remove any outliers and blank
          spaces. For data integrity, the data was checked for duplicates,
          spelling errors and name inconsistencies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exploratory Analysis:</strong> Descriptive statistical
          analysis and Pivot Table in Microsoft Excel and advanced SQL queries
          in PgAdmin were run to explore customer demographics, their purchase
          behaviour and ad platform effectiveness. Here is an example of a SQL
          code I used:
        </li>

        <pre>
          <code>
            The total spend per product per country

SELECT "country", 
SUM(m."liquor_sale") AS total_liqour_sales, 
SUM(m."fish_sale") AS total_fish_sales, 
SUM(m."veg_sale") AS total_veg_sales, 
SUM(m."nonveg_sale") AS total_non_veg_sales,
SUM(m."choc_sale") AS total_chocolate_sales, 
SUM(m."comm_sale") AS total_commodities_sales
FROM public.marketing_data m
GROUP BY "country"
ORDER BY "country" DESC;


          </code>
        </pre>

          <strong>Data Visualisation: </strong>Tableau was used to create
          interactive and engaging visualisations to showcase key findings.
          Excel charts and graphs were also used to display the insights.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
      <p>
        To improve online sales, 2Market should target customers aged 50-65 in
        Spain, Saudi Arabia, and Canada with ads on Twitter, Instagram, and Bulk
        Mail, focusing on liquor and non-vegetable products.
